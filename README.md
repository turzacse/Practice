# Smart Agriculture Farming

## Project Overview
Smart Agriculture Farming is a web application developed to assist farmers in making informed agricultural decisions using machine learning and deep learning. The project is divided into three key modules:
-	**Crop Recommendation:** Suggests the best crop to grow based on environmental and soil conditions.
-	**Fertilizer Recommendation:** Recommends optimal fertilizer combinations based on crop requirements and soil properties.
-	**Crop Disease Prediction:** Detects and identifies crop diseases from images, helping farmers take timely actions.
  
## Features
-	Crop Recommendation: Uses machine learning to suggest crops suitable for specific conditions.
-	Fertilizer Recommendation: Suggests appropriate fertilizers for optimal crop growth.
-	Crop Disease Prediction: Utilizes deep learning to analyze images of crops and detect diseases, offering quick and reliable diagnoses.
  
## Project Structure
### The project structure includes:
-	Frontend: A user-friendly interface for interacting with the recommendation and prediction modules.
-	Backend: Machine learning and deep learning models for prediction, powered by Python, Flask, and OpenCV.
-	Database: Stores crop, fertilizer, and disease data to support recommendations and predictions.
  
## Technologies Used
-	Programming Languages: Python
-	Framework: Flask
-	Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
-	Deep Learning: TensorFlow/Keras
-	Digital Image Processing: OpenCV
-	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-	Database: SQLite
  
## Installation and Setup
### To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1.	Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/myself-nahid/Smart-Agriculture-Farming.git
cd Smart-Agriculture-Farming
2.	Install Dependencies: Install all required packages listed in requirements.txt.
pip install -r requirements.txt
3.	Run the Application: Start the Flask server.
python app.py
4.	Access the Application: Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to use the application.
Usage
-	Crop Recommendation: Enter the soil and climate data to receive crop suggestions.
-	Fertilizer Recommendation: Input the crop type and soil properties to get fertilizer recommendations.
-	Crop Disease Prediction: Upload an image of a crop, and the system will detect potential diseases and provide diagnostic information.
